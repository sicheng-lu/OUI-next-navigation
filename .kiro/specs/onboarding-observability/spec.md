# Onboarding Experience: OpenSearch Observability Data Collection

## Overview

A step-by-step guided onboarding wizard for collecting data into OpenSearch Observability. The experience uses a split-panel layout:

- **Left panel (Conversation):** A guided conversational flow where the system asks questions and the user selects options (chips, cards, or buttons). Includes step progress indicator and status confirmations. Use assistant-ui components for conversational interface. Use tool-ui components option list when option type is checkbox or radio.
- **Right panel (Preview/Context):** A contextual panel that shows a visual preview of the user's selections, live data feedback, or supplementary information related to the current step.

**Chrome:** The page uses the same navigation shell and `samplePagesContentPanel` wrapper as all other pages. The left navigation rail is present but empty — it displays only the OpenSearch logo (no nav items, no footer icons). This keeps the onboarding visually consistent with the rest of the application while signaling that no other navigation is available during setup.

## Global Elements

| Element | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Step indicator | `Step X of 6` in H6 style, followed by the step title in H3 style below it | Shows progress and current step context |
| Progress dots | Horizontal dot trail between steps (timeline) | One dot per main step — indicates completed/current |
| "Finish onboarding later" link | Bottom center of page | Allows user to exit and resume later |
| Background | Light gradient (left panel slightly different from right) | Sets onboarding apart from main app |

---

## Flow Architecture (from diagram)

The onboarding flow is organized into 6 main steps. Step 1 contains sub-steps for environment selection and collector configuration:

| Main Step | Title | Sub-steps |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | What do you want to observe? | 1a. Choose observation goal, 1b. Select environment, 1b-eks. EKS auto-discovery (if EKS selected), 1c. Configure collector, 1d. Select telemetry storage |
| 2 | Connect your data source | — |
| 3 | Transform your data | — |
| 4 | Review and confirm | — |
| 5 | Collecting your data | — |
| 6 | You're all set! | — |

The step indicator displays `Step X/6` based on the main step number. Timeline dots track main step completion (not sub-steps).

#### Right Panel — Preview

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Panel title | `Telemetry Storage` |
| Panel subtitle | `Recommended for your setup` |
| Content type | Recommendation card |
| Content details | A single highlighted recommendation card showing: the recommended resource type (OpenSearch Managed Cluster or OpenSearch Serverless Collection), why it was chosen (e.g., "Your data volume and query pattern suggest a serverless collection for automatic scaling" or "Your retention requirements and steady workload are best served by a managed cluster"), and key specs — estimated OCUs or instance type, index pattern, and default retention period. Below the recommendation card, a muted comparison row shows the alternative option with a one-line summary of why it was not the primary recommendation. |
| Dynamic behavior | **"Looks good"** — accepts the recommendation, creates the resource with default settings, and advances to Step 2. **"Customize"** — expands the right panel into an editable configuration form where users can adjust: resource type (cluster vs. serverless), instance sizing or OCU allocation, number of replicas, retention policy, and index naming. A "Confirm" button in the form saves the customization and advances to Step 2. **"Store in existing"** — the right panel switches to a resource picker listing the user's existing OpenSearch clusters and serverless collections (fetched from their account). Each row shows: resource name, status, current utilization, and region. User selects one and clicks "Use this resource" to advance to Step 2. |
| Secondary section | A note: "You can change storage settings later from the Data Management page." |

#### Right Panel — Preview

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Panel title | `Data Transformations` |
| Panel subtitle | `Enrich and clean your log sources` |
| Content type | Configuration summary |
| Content details | A visual before/after comparison showing a sample log entry. The "before" shows raw log output with highlighted PII fields and missing metadata. The "after" updates dynamically based on selected transformations: PII fields redacted (shown as `[REDACTED]`) and/or service catalog fields appended (e.g., `service.team`, `service.environment`). |
| Dynamic behavior | As the user checks/unchecks transformations on the left, the "after" preview updates in real-time. When "Remove Personally Identifiable data" is checked, PII fields in the sample log are masked. When "Add service catalog data" is checked, additional metadata fields appear in the log entry. If nothing is selected, the "after" panel shows the raw log unchanged with a note: "No transformations selected." |
| Secondary section | **Pipeline Status** — Shows the current data connection health: ✓ "Connection valid — data flowing" or ⚠ "Connection issue — check credentials". If validation fails, an inline retry/fix prompt appears in the left panel. |

## Interaction Patterns

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Typing animation | System (assistant) messages are streamed word-by-word with a typing effect (~30ms per token), matching the thread page's streaming pattern. Interactive options (chips, multi-select) only appear after the typing animation completes. |
| Step transition | Auto-advances to the next step ~1 second after confirmation. No "Continue" button — the flow progresses automatically once the user makes a selection and the confirmation displays. The last step (Step 6) does not auto-advance; its chips navigate to other pages. When advancing to a new main step, the chat history from previous main steps is cleared — only sub-step history within the current main step is visible. |
| EKS auto-discovery path | When user selects "EKS" in sub-step 1b, the flow enters a parallel path (sub-step 1b-eks). The system automatically scans for EKS clusters (~2s scanning animation), displays "We found 3 EKS clusters and 14 services instrumented with OpenTelemetry" in the chat, waits 5 seconds for additional data to arrive, then auto-redirects to Step 4 (Review and confirm). This path bypasses sub-steps 1c, 1d, Step 2, and Step 3 entirely. |
| Back navigation | Users can click on any completed main step dot in the progress timeline to navigate back. Changes to earlier steps cascade-reset subsequent steps. Sub-step 1c also has an explicit "Go back" option that returns to 1b. |
| Skip steps | Sub-step 1b (environment) is skippable if user chose "sample data" in sub-step 1a. A "Skip" text link appears below the options. The EKS path automatically skips sub-steps 1c, 1d, Step 2, and Step 3. |
| Validation | Sub-steps 1a–1c and Step 2 require a selection before advancing. Step 2 additionally validates that the connection is successful before showing confirmation. Step 3 allows skipping without selection. Step 4 requires explicit confirmation via chip selection ("Looks good"). Step 5 requires user to click "Continue" chip after observing live data. The EKS auto-discovery step requires no user input — it auto-confirms after detection. |
| Loading states | Sub-step 1b-eks shows a scanning progress bar animation during cluster detection (~2s). Sub-step 1c shows a collector verification spinner when "I am ready" is clicked. Step 2 shows a connection/validation spinner (2–5s) after provider selection. Step 4 shows a deployment progress bar with stage indicators when user confirms. Step 5 shows live-updating counters immediately upon entering. |
| Completion | After Step 6, selecting a destination navigates the user out of the onboarding flow to the chosen feature (dashboards, discover, alerts, or back to onboarding for additional sources). |

## Visual Style Notes

Based on the screenshot reference:

- Left panel has a subtle gradient background (light blue/teal tint)
- Right panel has a card-based white container with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Option chips use dark fills with white text (pill-shaped buttons)
- Progress dots between steps use teal/green coloring
- "DONE" status cards have a green checkmark icon and bordered container
- Decision/validation states use yellow/amber highlighting (as seen in the flowchart's middle panel)
- Error states use red/destructive coloring with retry action
- Option chips and multi-select options are left-aligned, matching the system message alignment
- The overall feel is clean, spacious, and conversational

---

## Technical Notes

- This page is rendered at the `/onboarding-wizard` route
- Wrapped in the application chrome: a fixed-position outer container with the `samplePagesLeftNav` (logo-only, no nav items) and the `samplePagesContentPanel` content area
- The wizard itself uses `position: absolute` to fill the content panel (not `position: fixed`, since it lives inside the chrome wrapper)
- Built using OUI components (OuiFlexGroup, OuiText, OuiIcon, OuiStat, OuiToolTip, etc.)
- Only uses existing OUI icons from `src/components/icon/assets/`
- Must render correctly under both `v9-light` and `v9-dark` themes
- Step data is defined as a JS config array (`STEPS`), making it easy to add/remove/reorder steps
- Branching logic is handled in the auto-advance `useEffect`: sub-step 1b routes to either the EKS discovery step (index 2) or the OTel collector step (index 3) based on selection
- The EKS discovery step uses `optionType: 'auto-discovery'` — no user interaction required; auto-confirms after ~2s scanning then auto-advances to Step 4 after a 5s delay
- The `SummaryPanel` component dynamically adjusts displayed rows based on which path was taken (EKS vs. OTel), showing auto-configured values for skipped steps
- Validation logic (connection checks) will be async with timeout and retry support
- State management tracks: current step, selections per step, validation status, and connection health

## Example Step (from screenshot — Step 3)

For reference, here's how the screenshot content maps to this spec:

**Step Title:** `Connect your data source`

#### Left Panel
- **System message:** "Next: hook up your ⊙ telemetry. Where does your infrastructure live?"
- **Option type:** Chips
- **Options:** AWS, Azure, GCP, On-premises
- **Confirmation:** "✓ DONE — Connected to ⊙ Azure. I'm seeing ⊞ 6 services and ⊙ 42 log groups."

#### Right Panel
- **Panel title:** "Data sources"
- **Panel subtitle:** "Where telemetry comes from"
- **Content type:** Card grid
- **Content details:** 3–4 provider cards (AWS, Azure, GCP) each with logo, provider name, subtitle, and connection status. Azure shows "Connected" badge + "Live" indicator.
- **Secondary section:** "LIVE INGEST" dashboard showing event count (2,347 events/s), with sparkline rows for Metrics (~2,347/s), Logs (~189/s), Traces (~56/s), each with colored dot indicators and toggle switches.
